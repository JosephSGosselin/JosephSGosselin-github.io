            <p>We have lived in Haverhill all our lives. Our family all grew up playing soccer. This was heavily
                influenced by our mothers spanish origins. <br>
                When we were younger, we all went to a catholic school. Afterwards, we all also went to the same high
                school, Haverhill High School.

            <p>I started off my college career going to a community college named Northern Essex Community College. I
                spent 2 years here saving money. I then transfered into UML to gain my major in Computer Science. <br>
                After several years, I also decided to minor in Mathmatics. This is an exciting semester for me, since
                this is my last semester of college. Currently, I am taking the following classes: GUI, Comp 2300, Comp
                2350 and Stats 3650. <br>
                I have already received an offer for a full time position at Raytheon; which makes me even more excited
                to be finishing up my college career.
